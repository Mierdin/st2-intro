Intro to Stackstorm
-------------------

This repository houses configuration files and other metadata for demonstrating some basic stackstorm capabilities.

This repo is an active WIP; I plan to grow this heavily the more presentations on Stackstorm I give, so stay tuned!

(In the meantime, check out [st2vagrant](https://github.com/stackstorm/st2vagrant) for an easy way to get up and running with stackstorm!)
